This application is made in ASP.NET with docker. It´s a Rest Service i did for university.

## Get Started

- Download and install Docker [https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows

Considerations: 

- If you install Docker for Windows version after opening it you may get an error like “Unable to open Docker, user not in docker-users”.
- On Toolbox version, after opening Quickstart Terminal you might get the following error “This computer doesn’t have VT-X/AMD-v enabled. Enabling in BIOS is mandatory”.
